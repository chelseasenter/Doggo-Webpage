## Website Purpose
*We love dogs, what more can we say?*  <p>
The purpose of this website is to provide infomration on dog breeds, help users find their perfect dog, provide meaning data visualizations of our doggy data, and - last but not least - create a Dungeons&Dragons-style game where users can select dog characters to "play" against each other and see who wins out.  <p>  <p>
Our project had to include the following:
* Python Flask-powered API 
* HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
* One Database - relational or non-relational
* 1 of 4 Tracks
* A new JS Library not already used in the course
* Dataset with at least 100 records
* User-driven interactions (drop-downs, menus, textboxes)
* Visualizations with at least 3 views

This is how we decided to fulfill these requirements:
* *Python Flask-powered API, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript* - fulfilled when creating the website
* *One Database - relational or non-relational* - SQL (relational), using Postgres (PgAdmin)
* *1 of 4 Tracks* - custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
* *A new JS Library not already used in the course* - Lodash
* *Dataset with at least 100 records* - [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/), contains 172 dog breeds!
* *User-driven interactions (drop-downs, menus, textboxes)* - fulfilled when creating the structure of our website (dashboard)
* *Visualizations with at least 3 views* - 3 pages (Dog Breed information, Find Your Perfect Dog, Dog Data Visualization) each containing their own unique views of the data
