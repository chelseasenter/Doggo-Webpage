## Website Purpose
*We love dogs, what more can we say?*  <p>
  The purpose of this website is to provide infomration on dog breeds, help users find their perfect dog, provide meaning data visualizations of our doggy data, and - last but not least - create a Dungeons&Dragons-style game where users can select dog characters to "play" against each other and see who wins out.  <p>  <p>
  Our project had to include the following:
    * Python Flask-powered API 
    * HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
    * One Database
    * 1 of 4 Tracks
    * JS Library
    * Dataset with at least 100 records
    * User-driven interactions (drop-downs, menus, textboxes)
    * Visualizations with at least 3 views
